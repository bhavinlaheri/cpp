Cpp interview question and answer.

Q. What is class?
-> Class is user defined data types, which hold own data member and data function,
   which can be used and access by the instance of the class.

Q. What is object?
-> Object is instance of the class.

Q. What do you mean by access specifier?
-> There are three type of access specifier(also call modifier).
	1)Private
	2)Protect
	3)Public

   Private:
	The class member declared as private can be accessed only by the function inside
	the class ans fried class.They are not allowed to be accessed by the outside fuction
	or object.

   Public: 
	The classs member declared as public can be accessed directly by other fuction.

   Proctected:
	Proctected member is same as private but only differnce between is it accesssed in derived
	class of the class. 
	 
Q. List and explain OOPS concept.
-> OOPS concept are listed below.
	1)Encapsulation.
	2)Data abstraction
	3)Inheritance
	4)Polymorphism

	1) Encapsulation
	Encapsulation defined as bindind together ther data and functions that manipulates them.
	Note: Encapsulation is achived by the access specifier.
	
	2) Data abstraction
	Data abstraction means displaying essential information and hiding the details.
	
	3) Inheritance
	The capability of class to derive properties and characteristis from another class is called
	inheritance.

	4) Polimorphism
	One name but many forms.





Q. Difference betweeen class and struct in cpp.
-> There two difference between class and structure in cpp.
	1) Default access specifier in class is privat but for strucyt it is public,
		i.e there is no encapsulation.
	2) When struct derived from other struct default access specifier is puclic,
		for class it is private.

Except above differnce class and strcut is same in cpp.
